TicTacToe
=========

This is a HTML5 implementation of and old paper and pen game. Tic Tac Toe is played on 3x3 grid. Two players play in turn by writing X or O on any available square. Player that manages to connect three symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins.

This game was developed as my first try at HTML5 game development and canvas graphics. This game is also my first try of deploying packaged web apps to Firefox marketplace.

You can play the game online or install it onto your device on: http://www.quineinteractive.com/tictactoe.htm.
